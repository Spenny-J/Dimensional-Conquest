This is a system of tools I want to create to give my player some smooth good feeling during play.
For now I have a good place to start for my Jedi player controller to have in VR.
Anything new will be written under the Parkour section

Key Features:
* Player Controller Manager
[X] * Analog movement (with walking support)
[X] * Jumping
[_] * Grabbing
[X] * Force Manipulate (1 object)
[_] * Massive Force Push/Pull
[X] * Physics body (everything) (I believe this is done)
[X] * Parkour (This needs to be expounded upon)
* Investigate the steam_VR treadmill support

[X] Player Library to keep movements such as the movment type (HMD, Right Controller, Left Controller)

Player Controller Manager
This will be used to keep track of what the hell we are doing with each controller and so we can customize our settings to be a bit not so tight
* Keep track if hand is force grabbing an object
* Keep track if hand is grabbing an object
* Just make the grabbing object public as well as the force grabbed object
* Manage movement method
[X] * Hand manager (Track if hand is doing anything)

Analog Movement
Just move using a thumbpad essentially, this should support my new VR treadmill just fine
[X] - Use X-input to move forward, back, left, and right
[X] - Create library to hold any control enums
[X] - Use input from the VR controller to control the player
- Create a manager where this field can be edited in game
- Save this data on the system

 [X] Jumping
	Just add the functionality to jump
	* May want to look at what they used for Mario and try that out and see how it feels in VR
	* Just a button to jump when touching the ground
	[X] - Jump using keyboard input
	[X] - Jump using VR controller input

 Grabbing
	I want to grab objects
	* Detect when my hand is near an object and grab it, disable the hand object
	* Parent the object to the hand
	[X] * Is grabbable script
	[X] - Grab object script
	[X] - Can grab any object in layermask
	- GrabbableObj script for:
		[X] * Can see if already grabbed by a hand (Grab/Force grab)
		[X] * Can see if second hand is grabbing (Grab/Force grab)
		[X] * [Force Grab] Function to pass in the Vector from hands
		[X] - 2 vector values then we take the midpoint if each vector != null
		[X] - Can tell if held by 1 or both hands
		[X] - If held with both we want to double the force amount
		[X] - If held with both we want to center the object halfway in between the force position we originally set
		[X] * Event for using the object (pulling trigger or other button)
	- If 1 hand already grabbing object, use second hand grabbing for rotation
		* Specifically quarternion look rotation (or opposite for melee weapons)

Force Manipulate (1 obj)
Similar to half life alyx we want to: 
	[X] * highlight an object
	[X] * Grab the highlighted object once user closes hand
	[X] * Change objects position by an offset
	[X] * If user yanks hand back we pull the object toward their head
	[X] * If user jolts hand forward we throw object away from head
	[X] - Can grab 1 object with both hands
	- Change object position (closer/further from player based on rotation of hand)
	- Change object rotation (based on force grabbing with other hand)
	- Add velocity when grabbing with 1 hand
	* If user yanks back on usuable items (lightsaber/guns/etc) it will do the half life alyx thing
Work in progress

Massive Force Push/Pull (all objects)
Will want to create a "magic system" similar to Forces system. I would like it to be gesture based, and use a velocity value.
Similar to what we have used before.
	//* Force push all objects in front of head/hand in a cone
	//* Force pull all objects in front of head/hand in a cone
	[X] - Force Gesture Manager
	  [X] * Events for activating different force abilities (Up/down, left/right, forward/back)
	- Force Abilities LIbrary
	  [X] * Force push all objects in front of me
	  * Force pull all objects in front of me
	  * Force throw all objects to the sides
	[X] - Force Gesture Hand
	  


Parkour:
I can jump around grab on to objects to get to areas I thought I could not get to previously.
Take a look at stride for good examples.
[X] - Grab onto a ledge or other object to move about.
    [X] * When I grab onto an object I want to move the entire playspace
	[X] * On grab the player collider super small so I can move myself onto that object
	[X] * On release reset the size of the collider
- Ability to jump that doesn't make other people feel sick
