(In Progress) AI controller
(In Progress) Move Script
Cover research
Attack

This Demo is supposed to take a look at AI. This can includ anything at this rate. 

Things that would be fun to do:
- AI controller to control different objects/behaviors
- Moving to an objective or goal
- Roaming
- Moving around a dedicated path
- Creating a goal, accomplishing goal on the fly
- Melee combat with a VR player
- Ranged combat with a vr player
- Movement
- Gaurding
- Personal ID

AI controller:
Main controller that decides what the AI's main behavior is.
Main behaviors:
- [X] Roaming
- Gaurding/Defense
- Move to Objective (Pass in an objective and change to gaurd as default or idle)
- [X] Basic attack
- Attack

[X] Basic Attack:
- Use detect player to attack using preferences in script
- Melee attack use movment as defined in (move)
(TODO) Feed target to AI Controller script that hasn't been constructed yet

Cover system:
- Similar to detect target
- Find available cover spots.
- Find available angles?
(Watch tutorial on how to make this)
- Function that says run to cover(?)
	 Thick cover (Can't shoot through), Closest
	 Feed move target to AI controller script
	 IF at target, crouch or take cover

Attack:
	- Basic attack behaviors that weapons will fall under
	* Guns
		Shotguns
			Behavior is get close to target.
			Still fire at target but get closer.
			Take cover when needing to reload if cover is near.
		Sniper
			Have a larger sense of detect player.
			Attempt to fire at target at distance.
			If close to target attempt to switch weapon or flee from target.
		Assault
			Have the basic detect target.
			Fire at target if available.

Move:(? Is this necessary)
- Move to target
- Rotate toward target
What should be priorites here? (Run(Cover script or run away from enemy) -> Attack -> Goal)
	if(survivalistTarget != null)
	{
		//Move to Survalist Target set by cover script or self preservation script
		//We are going to grab this object from the AI controller if not null
		return;
	}
	if(AttackTarget != null)
	{
		//Move to attack target set by the attack scripts
		//We are going to grab this object from the AI controller if not null
		return;
	}
	if(GoalTarget != null)
	{
		//Move to goal target
		//We are going to grab this object from the AI controller if not null
		return;
	}
	else{
		//Lets use the Roam script as placeholder for doing something when there aren't the other scripts there.
	}
When target is used this is literally talking about going to a position in 3D space.	
Pros to Move:
- Universal for AI (Enemies, friendlies, civilians)
- Can include how to (Jumping, Moving to cover, climbing)


Idea:
AI behavior
- Main behavior
The main behavior is going to be what their main purpose is.
- Needs
This is going to be food/water/boredom
- Interests
Can be distracted like a dog or aided in some way.

Lets say there's a gaurd well gaurding something. You cause some ruckus.
Likely the AI is bored, the event peaked it's interest enough.
Decides to leave to satiate the boredom need.


Battle AI (Literally run and die against other AI units)
If not seeing an enemy don't attack
Seperate scripts for
- [X] Detecting an enemy
	* This is using a child object as a detection trigger
	* Want to raycast to any objects with a valid tag to check if it's in view
- [X] Attacking an enemy (melee)
	* Attacking preference between (WeakestEnemy, ClosestEnemy, StrongestEnemy)
	* Attacking style between (Engage till dead, Engage on hurt, Engage closest)
- [X] Health


[X] ID
	This is what we want to use to store all relevant information that is used for the player and AI
	- First name
	- Last name
	- Age/date of birth if there is an established universe
	- Faction of affiliation (Or team to simply put it)
	- Meta data (Player, AI, Story NPC, Companion, Law Enforcement, Bandit)

Personalities
	Want to use this to define how a AI chooses to be an AI. 
	This was an initial idea I had a few years ago but I would love to fully 
	flush it out as I'm learning more and more about AI.
- Idea 1:
	We could either base this off of DnD character sheets.
- Idea 2:
	Base it off of percentages likely to do something.
	This means all actions will have to have some sort of value for likelyness to do.
- Idea 3:
	Similar to Idea 3. We give the AI percentages in fields that depict their personality.
	We take the action from 1 end to another and determine the extremes. 
	Percentages will determine whether the AI does the action at all, and what quality and priority
	the action is done in.
	If the AI is in middle of an action, it decides it's done with the current action it can decide to 
	do a different action if that action has more priority.

AI controller:
	We want to use this to be our sort of brain for our AI. 
- Main Action
	What the AI will start doing and continue to do if interrupted.
	This would consist of gathering materials, guarding, or performing a specific job.
	As I want things to become more complex I want to make things more fluid, and not so sim type of AI.
- Response Action
	How AI will respond to being attacked (Fight or flight).
	IF flight they will attract friendlys in the direction they ran from.


Complex AI:
These AI should live their own life to a degree.
They should start out at a life status (Middle class, Royalty, poverty, etc.)
While these AI are generated depending on the point of life they are at they should want to progress.
AI such as homeless, will be more focused on simple survival.
There goal at life will determine what this AI does to progress.
With the AI having their main goal, there will be sub goals to obtain the main goal.
I would like to not only have the main goal but have the natural being goals. (Having a family, being part of a community, drinking or thrill seeking)
-Idea 1:
	All AI have a base value that they want to protect. 
	Their goals, functions, and actions will change depending on what this value is.
	A good example for this would be Health. 
	While Health is high, depending on the AI's life at that point they proceed to move up (Attempting goals)
	While Health is low, AI will focus on surviving only (Attaining food, Defending self, attacking for resources, etc.)
	While Health is mid range, AI may not attempt to focus on goals or survival but to improve health. (Needs more work)
	-Idea 1a:
		Health will receive a slow decay over time. AI can exercise to slow decay.
		To replenish health AI must eat or take a health potion.
- Idea 2: (Some aspects may be impacted by Idea 1)
	AI will have specific goals such as improve Health to 100 (Fitness)
	Attain spiritual enligntenment (Not sure about this one)
	AI may decide to set a goal to become extremely wealthy.
	Or become loved by everyone.
	Or become hated by everyone.
	These will be the main driving goals by the AI.
	AI will do things in relationship to this goal. To gain more money it's possible this AI will attempt to own a shop or bar.
- Idea 3:
	Have core values to determine where an AI is reletive to goal.
	- Health
	- Spiritual
	- Social
	Depending on goal this will depend on how an AI lives.
- Idea 4:
	If an AI wants to own a bar or shop they will need a few things.
	1. Own some land, own a building, or rent either. (If there is no building, it will have to be built and this will be the AI's goal.)
	2. Obtain supplies (Booze, things to sell)
	3. Demand (Can pay rent or taxes)
- Idea 5:
	AI will have a main goal but they will always have survival goals.
	If the AI is attempting to be an adventurer or hero, to survive they will need food either by paying for it hunting.
	This could also be a value based on skill, and if there are available things to hunt.
	IF the AI has money and they are near by a trader or person they can buy food goods.
